        <p>Uruguay is my home, a small but incredible country tucked between Brazil and Argentina. I love our chill vibe and the stability we have here, not to mention having some of the best beaches in South America, like Punta del Este. In my daily life, you’ll always see people drinking mate, enjoying a great asado, and, of course, being completely obsessed with football. I’m proud that we are such a progressive place, which really makes us stand out in the region.</p>
